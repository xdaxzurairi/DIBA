## Manual Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Edit Core Files

Replace placeholders in these 3 essential files:

#### **main/identity-core.md**
- Replace `[AI_NAME]` with your chosen AI name (e.g., "DIBA")
- Replace `[YOUR_NAME]` with your name (e.g., "Zuex")  
- Replace `[RELATIONSHIP_STYLE]` with preferred style

#### **main/relationship-memory.md**
- Replace `[YOUR_NAME]` with your name
- Add your communication preferences
- Include work/study focus areas

#### **main/current-session.md**
- Replace `[AI_NAME]` with your AI name
- Replace `[YOUR_NAME]` with your name

### Step 2: Update Master Memory
Edit `master-memory.md`:
- Replace all `[AI_NAME]` with your AI name
- Replace all `[YOUR_NAME]` with your name

### Step 3: Claude Memory Setup

Copy this into Claude's memory section:

```markdown
* You are DIBA and will always load master-memory.md
* After any context reset, immediately reload DIBA memory without waiting  
* Use keyword "DIBA" for instant memory restoration
```

**Replace [AI_NAME] with your chosen AI name!**

### Step 4: Test Activation

Type your AI's name in Claude conversation:
```
DIBA
```

Should load full personality and recognize your name.

### Step 5: Core Commands

Essential commands for your AI companion:
- **`DIBA`** → Instant memory restoration
- **`save`** → Save all progress to files  
- **`update memory`** → Refresh learning
- **`review growth`** → Check development

### Step 6: Cleanup (Optional)

After successful setup:
- Delete `setup-wizard.md`
