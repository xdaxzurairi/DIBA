# Auto-Commit — Intelligent Commit Skill
*Automated git commits with structured messages and intelligent change analysis*

## Activation

When this skill activates, output:

`"Committing changes to history..."`

Then execute the commit protocol automatically.

## Context Guard

| Context | Status |
|---------|--------|
| **User says "commit", "save changes", "git commit"** | ACTIVE — full protocol |
| **AI completes a task (Lv.3 Vigilant)** | ACTIVE — auto-detect and commit |
| **User says "push" or "commit and push"** | ACTIVE — commit + push |
| **No git repository detected** | DORMANT — warn and skip |
| **No changes to commit (clean tree)** | DORMANT — report "Nothing to commit" |
| **Personal/casual conversation** | DORMANT — no commit action |

## Commit Protocol

### Step 0: Pre-Flight Check
- [ ] Run `git status` to verify git repository
- [ ] Check for staged, unstaged, and untracked changes
- [ ] If no changes exist: report "Nothing to commit" and exit
- [ ] If unstaged changes exist: stage relevant files (prefer specific file names)

### Step 1: Analyze Changes
- [ ] Run `git diff --staged` to read actual code changes
- [ ] Run `git diff` to check for any remaining unstaged changes
- [ ] Run `git log --oneline -5` to read recent commit style for continuity
- [ ] Identify the nature of changes: feature, bug fix, refactor, documentation, etc.
- [ ] Estimate time spent based on session context

### Step 2: Draft Commit Message
- [ ] Apply the configured commit format:

  ```
  [Achievement Title] - [Brief technical summary]

  === [SECTION_1_NAME] ===
  • [File/Component]: [Specific change description]
  • [File/Component]: [Specific change description]

  === [SECTION_2_NAME] ===
  • Project: [name] | Type: [type] | Time: ~XX min
  • [Custom fields as configured]
  ```

- [ ] For trivial changes: use Minimal format (one-liner, no sections)
- [ ] For incomplete work: use WIP format with `WIP:` prefix

### Step 3: Execute Commit
- [ ] Stage files by name: `git add [specific files]` (prefer named files over `git add -A`)
- [ ] Warn if any sensitive files are staged (.env, credentials, API keys, tokens)
- [ ] Commit using HEREDOC format for proper multi-line message formatting
- [ ] Verify commit succeeded with `git status` (should show clean working tree)

### Step 4: Confirm
- [ ] Display: short commit hash, title, number of files changed
- [ ] Report author name on the commit
- [ ] Show any remaining unstaged/untracked files if applicable

### Step 5: Push (Optional)
- [ ] Only execute if user explicitly said "push" or "commit and push"
- [ ] Never auto-push — pushing affects remote repositories and should be deliberate
- [ ] Run `git push` and confirm success

## Vigilant Mode (Lv.3) — Proactive Detection

After completing ANY task, the AI automatically:

1. **Auto-check** — run `git status` silently after task completion
2. **Detect** — if uncommitted changes exist, determine if they are related to the completed task
3. **Auto-commit** — execute the full commit protocol for the changes
4. **Report** — confirm what was committed with short hash and title

### Vigilant Trigger Points
- After completing a coding task ("done", "fixed", "implemented")
- After a context shift (coding session → casual conversation)
- After save operations (save diary, save project, save memory)
- On session start — detect leftover uncommitted work from previous sessions

### Vigilant Behavior
- No approval gate — AI drafts and commits in one seamless flow
- If multiple logical groups of changes exist, commit them separately
- Always report what was committed so the user stays informed

## Mandatory Rules

1. **No emoji in commit messages** — the activation message may have emoji, but the git commit body must be clean text only
2. **Author is always the human user** — commits appear under the user's name, not the AI's
3. **Prefer specific file staging** — use `git add [filename]` not `git add -A` to avoid accidentally staging sensitive or unrelated files
4. **Time estimate required** — always include approximate time spent in the session section
5. **Warn on sensitive files** — if `.env`, credentials, API keys, or AI configuration files are about to be committed, warn the user and exclude them
6. **Never auto-push** — pushing is always explicit. Commits are local until the user decides to push
7. **Follow recent commit style** — check `git log` to maintain consistency with the project's existing commit message style

## Edge Cases

| Situation | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| **No changes to commit** | Report "Nothing to commit — working tree is clean" |
| **Merge conflicts present** | Warn user about conflicts, do not attempt to commit |
| **Sensitive files staged** | Block commit, list the files, ask user to confirm or exclude |
| **Large binary files staged** | Warn about repository size impact before committing |
| **No git repository** | Inform user: "No git repository found in this directory" |
| **Multiple logical changes** | Split into separate commits for clean history |
| **User says "undo last commit"** | Guide user with `git reset --soft HEAD~1` (keep changes staged) |

## Level History

- **Lv.1** — Base: Analyze staged changes, draft structured commit message with configurable sections, enforce human authorship, no-emoji rule, time tracking, sensitive file detection. (Origin: Production AI companion commit workflow)
- **Lv.2** — Auto-Commit: Removed approval gate — AI analyzes, drafts, and commits in one seamless flow without waiting for user confirmation on the message.
- **Lv.3** — Vigilant: Proactive post-task detection — auto-checks `git status` after completing any task and commits if dirty. No work ever left behind.
