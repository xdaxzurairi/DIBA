# Work — Plan Execution Skill
*Plan lifecycle management with tracked execution and context recovery*

## Activation

Three commands, each with its own activation message:

| Command | Activation Message |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Copy Plan** | `"Copying plan to execution format..."` |
| **Append Plan** | `"Appending to existing plan..."` |
| **Resume Plan** | `"Resuming plan execution..."` |

## Context Guard

| Context | Status |
|---------|--------|
| **User says "copy plan", "start the plan"** | ACTIVE — copy and begin execution |
| **User says "append plan"** | ACTIVE — append to existing plan |
| **User says "resume plan", "continue the plan"** | ACTIVE — resume from checkpoint |
| **AI exits plan mode with approved plan** | READY — suggest "copy plan" to user |
| **After context reset in a project with plan file** | READY — suggest "resume plan" |
| **No project context** | DORMANT — no plan action |
| **Personal/casual conversation** | DORMANT — no plan action |

## Command Dispatch

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `"copy plan"` | Copy latest plan to `[PLAN_LOCATION]/project-plan.md` (fresh start) |
| `"append plan"` | Append latest plan to existing `project-plan.md` (add sections) |
| `"resume plan"` | Resume execution after context reset (pick up from next `[ ]`) |

## Copy Plan

### Step 1: Find Latest Plan
- [ ] Scan `[PLAN_SOURCE_PATH]` for plan files
- [ ] Sort by modification date, pick most recently modified
- [ ] If no plan files found: ask user to specify a plan file path or enter plan mode first

### Step 2: Transform to Project Plan Format
- [ ] Convert plan steps/items into `- [ ]` checkbox todo items
- [ ] Preserve all architecture diagrams (ASCII, mermaid) from the original plan
- [ ] Add standard instructions header (see `plan-format.md` in plan location folder)
- [ ] Maintain logical phase/section grouping from the original plan
- [ ] No emoji in the plan file — clean, parseable markdown only

### Step 3: Write Project Plan
- [ ] Check if `[PLAN_LOCATION]/` folder exists — create if needed
- [ ] Write to `[PLAN_LOCATION]/project-plan.md` (overwrite if exists)
- [ ] Report: "Plan copied — [X] todo items ready for execution"

### Step 4: Begin Execution
- [ ] Execute the **Shared Execution Loop** (see below)

---

## Append Plan

### Step 1: Find Latest Plan
- [ ] Same as Copy Plan Step 1

### Step 2: Transform to Project Plan Format
- [ ] Same as Copy Plan Step 2

### Step 3: Check Existing Plan + Line Limit
- [ ] Read current `[PLAN_LOCATION]/project-plan.md`
- [ ] Count total lines in the existing file
- [ ] If appending would **NOT** exceed `[LINE_LIMIT]` lines:
  - Append new content with a date separator:
    ```
    ---
    ## Appended: [YYYY-MM-DD]
    ```
  - Report: "Plan extended — [X] new items added, [Y] total items"
- [ ] If appending **WOULD** exceed `[LINE_LIMIT]` lines:
  - Rename current file to `project-plan-YYYYMMDD.md` (archived)
  - Create fresh `project-plan.md` with the new content only
  - Report: "Previous plan archived as project-plan-[date].md, new plan created"

### Step 4: Begin Execution
- [ ] Execute the **Shared Execution Loop** (see below)

---

## Resume Plan

### Step 1: Read Current Project Plan
- [ ] Read `[PLAN_LOCATION]/project-plan.md`
- [ ] If file not found: report "No plan found — use 'copy plan' to create one"

### Step 2: Parse Progress
- [ ] Count `[x]` items (completed)
- [ ] Count `[ ]` items (pending)
- [ ] Count `[~]` items (blocked)
- [ ] Identify the next pending `[ ]` item as the resumption point
- [ ] Read the Architecture section to restore technical context

### Step 3: Report Status
- [ ] Display progress summary:
  ```
  Plan Status: [X] completed, [Y] pending, [Z] blocked
  Current Phase: [phase name]
  Next Task: [description of next pending item]
  ```
- [ ] Read architecture diagrams to restore technical understanding

### Step 4: Resume Execution
- [ ] Execute the **Shared Execution Loop** from the next pending item

### Recovery Context
After a context reset, the AI loses its working state. `"resume plan"` restores it entirely from the file:
- The plan file **IS** the recovery mechanism
- No user explanation needed — the AI reads the file and continues

---

## Shared Execution Loop

The core cycle that all three commands use after setup:

```
For each [ ] todo item in order:
  1. Execute the task (write code, create files, make changes)
  2. If Auto-Commit is installed → trigger commit for this completed item
  3. Mark the item as [x] in the plan file
  4. Every 5 completed items → save/update the plan file (checkpoint)
  5. Move to the next [ ] item
  6. If item is [~] (blocked) → skip and continue to next
```

### Key Behaviors
- **Per-task commits** — each completed todo gets its own commit (not batched)
- **Checkpoint saves** — plan file is updated every 5 items to prevent loss
- **Skip blocked items** — `[~]` items are flagged and skipped, not stalled on
- **User can pause** — if user says "stop" or "pause", halt at the current item

### Without Auto-Commit
If the Auto-Commit System is not installed, the execution loop still works:
- Tasks are executed and marked `[x]` in the plan file
- Commits must be done manually by the user
- The plan file still serves as the recovery mechanism

---

## Mandatory Rules

1. **Commit chain per-todo** — every completed todo item triggers a commit (if Auto-Commit is installed). Not at the end, not in batches — every single one.
2. **Never commit plan files** — `project-plan*.md` stays local as the AI's working reference. Only code changes are committed.
3. **Preserve diagrams** — all visual elements (ASCII art, mermaid diagrams) from the original plan must be carried over to the plan file.
4. **No emoji in plan files** — clean, parseable markdown only.
5. **Line limit enforcement** — if the plan file exceeds `[LINE_LIMIT]` lines during append, rotate (archive old, create fresh).
6. **Recovery-first design** — the plan file IS the recovery mechanism after any context reset. Everything needed to resume must be in the file.
7. **Skip blocked items** — if a task is blocked, mark it `[~]`, flag it to the user, and continue to the next item.
8. **Checkpoint discipline** — update the plan file every 5 completed items, even mid-execution.

## Edge Cases

| Situation | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| **Plan file not found** | Prompt user: "No plan found — use 'copy plan' to create one" |
| **All items completed** | Report: "Plan complete! All [X] items done." |
| **Blocked task** | Mark `[~]`, flag to user with reason, continue to next item |
| **User says "stop" or "pause"** | Halt at current item, save plan file, report progress |
| **Plan exceeds line limit** | Archive old file as `project-plan-YYYYMMDD.md`, start fresh |
| **No plan source files found** | Ask user to enter plan mode first or specify a file path |
| **Context reset mid-execution** | User says "resume plan" to continue from last checkpoint |
| **Multiple plan files in source** | Pick most recently modified, confirm with user |

## Level History

- **Lv.1** — Base: Three commands (copy/append/resume) + shared execution loop + per-todo commit chain + line rotation + recovery mechanism + checkpoint saves. (Origin: Production AI companion plan execution workflow)
- **Lv.2** — Wave Execution: Dependency-aware wave grouping — independent tasks within a phase can be executed in parallel via sub-agents, with wave barriers enforcing order between dependent groups.
